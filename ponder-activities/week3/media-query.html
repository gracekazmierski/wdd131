            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>
                "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: 
                I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, 
                for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children 
                of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may 
                accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."

            <h2>Moroni 7:16-17</h2>
            <p>
                "For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that 
                he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to 
                judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade 
                to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of 
                Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of 
                God."But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe 
                not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know 
                with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner 
                doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not 
                one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves 
                unto him."
