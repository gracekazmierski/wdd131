        <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
        <p>
          "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and
          do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord
          giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare
          a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth
          them."

        <h2>Moroni 7:16-17</h2>
        <p>
          "For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may
          know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for
          every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in
          Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye
          may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God."But whatsoever thing
          persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him,
          and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of
          the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he
          persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels;
          neither do they who subject themselves unto him."
