          <h2>Hey there!</h2>
          <p>My name is Grace Kazmierski, and I am the creator of this webpage. I am a student at BYU-Idaho, but I was born and raised in Billings, Montana. My family stems from a long line of dude-ranchers and farm workers in Southeastern Montana. It is from them that I learned how to play <strong>Arkansas Rocks</strong>!</p>
        
          <p><em>Arkansas Rocks</em> has been passed down from generation to generation on camping trips, long days on the ranch, or road trips across the state. But it wasn’t started in our family. My great-grandpa Bob learned the game at a small bar in Arkansas while he was there buying a racehorse.</p>
        
          <p>The game is easy to play but wildly addicting. The first time that I learned how to play was on a road trip to the Black Hills Caverns. My mom bought 15 rocks from the Rushmore Cave gift shop and we carried them with us on every road trip after. My mom is incredibly good at the game — I have only beat her a handful of times!</p>
        
          <p>I decided to turn the game into a website for my final project in my dynamic web design course. The site uses a combination of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> to bring the game to life. Although it was the longest project I have ever completed, I learned a lot in the process. I hope you enjoy!</p>
