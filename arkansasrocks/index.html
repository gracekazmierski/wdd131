          <h2>Welcome to Arkansas Rocks!</h2>
          <p>Hey there, I am your game host, Mr. Arkansas! I will be your guide throughout the game. I will help you learn how to play and give you some tips along the way.</p>
          <p>Arkansas Rocks is a game involving 3 rows of 15 rocks. Players take turns picking rocks up from each row. You can pick as many rocks as you'd like, but you can only pick rocks from one row at a time. The player who picks up the last rock loses!</p>
          <p>You can find more detailed instructions on how to play the game on the <a href="instructions.html">Instructions</a> page. The one thing to always keep in mind is to avoid picking up the last rock!</p>
          <p>The game originated in a small bar in Arkansas. Because it requires only 15 rocks, it is easy to set up and costs nothing to the players. Arkansas Rocks can be played anywhere, anytime, and by anyone.</p>
          <p>If you would like more information on the history of the game, please check out the <a href="game-history.html">Game History</a> page.</p>
          <p>Just like the game Four In A Row, there are strategies to the game. When playing the game, pay attention to both the rocks and the rows...chosing the right amount is only the first step. But remember, it’s all about having fun. Don’t sweat it if you lose—just try again!</p>
          <p>So grab a friend, a drink, and some rocks, and let's get started!</p>
          <p>Click the "Play" below to start the game!</p>
