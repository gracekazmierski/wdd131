            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                This website is the platform to play the game Arkansas Rocks, a game created by my
                great-grandfather at a bar in Arkansas. The game is simiar to the game "Nim" and is
                played with 15 rocks - 3 in the top row, 5 in the middle row, and 7 in the bottom
                row. The game is played with two players. During their turn, a player can take as
                many rocks as they want but can only take rocks from a single row. The player to
                pick up the last rock loses. This website will allow players to learn the rules of
                the game and play it virtually.
            </p>

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                My audience is anyone looking to play a simple game online with their friend. It
                might be two bored students looking to pass time in class, or in my grandfather's
                case, two guys with nothing better to do than play a simple game. Arkansas Rocks is
                a similar challenge to four-in-a-row: it's a simple game with simple strategy.
            </p>
            <!-- change this -->

            <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
            <p>
                For the game function, I will need to dynamically generate each row of rocks and
                display them as clickable elements. The player should be able to click rocks to
                select them, and rock selection should be limited to one row per turn. When a player
                confirms their move, selected rocks should hide.
                <br />
                I will also need to dynamically generate a message to display the winner of the
                game. The message should be displayed in a modal that appears when the game is over.
                The modal should have a button to close it and reset the game.
                <br />
                I will need to have an element that displays the current player's turn. This element
                should update when the player makes a move.
                <br />
                There should also be game dynamics, such as highlighted rocks for selection,
                animations for rock selection, alerts for invalid moves, and an alert when the game
                ends.
            </p>

            <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
            <nav>

            <hr />

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <h3>Home page</h3>
            <p>
                The landing page will be a selection screen where players can chose to learn the
                rules of the game, begin a game, or learn the history of the game. It will have a
                player guide (Bob, a cowboy) that guides them through selection. It will also have a
                header with the game title, and a footer with my information.
            </p>
            <h3>Instruction Page</h3>
            <p>
                Page two will be the instructions for the game. The instructions will be split up
                into four slides and have a visual of the game board on the side. It will explain
                the rules, player moves, and how to win the game.
            </p>
            <h3>Game Page</h3>
            <p>
                The game page will be where players can play the game. The fifteen rocks will be in
                the center screen. Player icons will be on their respective sides of the screen
                (player one on the left, player two on the right). The game will have a header with
                the game title, a footer with my information, and a button to return to reset the
                board. It will also have a help icon in the bottom right corner that will display
                the instructions when clicked. The board background will visually represent a game
                board.
            </p>
            <h3>Game History</h3>
            <p>
                The game history page will display a short summary of how the game was created. It
                will have a button to return to the home screen, but otherwise will not be
                interactive.
            </p>
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

            <h3>Home</h3>
            <p>
                This will be the landing page for the website. The header will contain the logo and
                game title. The main text will be an introduction. Each of the three buttons will
                navigate to another page, and the cowboy image will be the game guide.
            </p>
            <img src="wireframes/home-wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

            <h3>Game</h3>
            <p>
                This will be where the player actually plays the game. Each of the 15 boxes
                represent one rock. The player tags will alternate popping out to indicate which
                player's turn it is. The help button in the corner will be a reminder of the
                instructions.
            </p>
            <img src="wireframes/gameboard-wireframe.png" alt="page 2 wireframe" />

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>
                This will be the official page for learning the instructions, guided by the cowboy
                Bob. Each of the 15 boxes represent a rock to walk the players through a an example
                game.
